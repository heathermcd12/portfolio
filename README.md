###*Storyteller, dreamer and doer*

I love the world of design and have become emersed in motion, illustration and branding. 

##The funnest facts ever:

1. I love black and white, colour can sometimes overwhelm the overall design.
2. I have unruly, curly hair that has a life of its own.
3. Fun-loving illustrator that can yammer on about everything.
4. I'm handsy, in a non-threatning way. I love doing hands on projects, that is where I can fully let out all my creativity.
