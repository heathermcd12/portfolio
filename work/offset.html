            <p>OFFSET is designed to be simple and visually appealing to keep it’s user engaged. There is one goal, which is to track the user’s carbon footprint stats over a 5 day period. I was inspired by clean reversed type and lots of green. I chose green due to its significance with being associated with nature, ecology and renewal.</p>

            <h3 class="push-1-2">Process</h3>
            <p>The process of making this app included research, conceptual thinking and storytelling. The application began as sketches and prototypes which both went through user testing. Soon came the design, which is inspired by renewal and nature. The app was designed in Illustrator and animated in After Effects.</p>
