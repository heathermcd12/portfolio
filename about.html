            <h1 class="pad-t">Hi there / Bonjour</h1>
            <p>I'm Heather Lynn, an unruly-haired graphic design student in her final year of Graphic Design at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada. Currently on the search of an internship that will fulfill my need to be hands-on with projects and allow my creativity to roam. Passionate about art direction, motion graphics, illustration and printmaking. I love to mix art and design, whether it be using a letterpress to make a poster or cutting up jeans for an editorial.</p>

            <p>Outside of design, I have hobbies too! I love to spend days outdoors, make floral arrangements and play with animals. I bake a lot, take printmaking classes and love telling stories.</p>
        
            <h3 class="pad-t" >Work Experience</h2>
            
            <p>I have one year of work experience in design studios. Working for studios such as <a href="http://greenmeloninc.com" target="_blank">Greenmelon Inc</a>. and <a href="http://www.anickbauerdesign.com" target="_blank">Anick Bauer Design</a> has helped me realize which talents I should focus on and how to collaborate with other designers to create something meaningful.</p>
            
            <h3 class="pad-t">Clients</h2>
            <p>Record Centre, Wheelhouse, Anick Bauer Design, Sparrow Floral, Purple Urchin.</p>
            
            <h3 class="pad-t">Need a hand?</h2>
